# The Types of Document

## A guide for new IT learners

A document or webpage explaining the outline of a subject in simple terms with illustration.

There are simple text based ways of creating these types of documents. Markdown etc. 

### Examples

These are intros to various subjects, they feature plenty of images and some have videos to inspire interest and engagment.

### Suggestions of software / format
* Webpage (will need to be printable and savable for off line)
* Markdown on github / glitch.com / hackmd.io etc.
* Word doc / PDF 

## A presentation with speaker notes 

PowerPoint is not the only Presentation Software, there are text based ones I like, based on Markdown i.e. https://hackmd.io/@meggleton/H1LSzfzoT#/

# Spec / Markscheme
The exact wording from the Spec / Markscheme is included below so you can see it but the instructions above should be what you do.

## LO1 Understand the purpose and stages of data analysis and design

### P1
Explain the types of data that can be  analysed

#### Guidance
Learners should explain the four different data types identified in the [teaching content](/content%2F1-1%20Data%20types/Intro.md), using appropriate examples they have researched. This can be
in the form of a guide for new IT learners, a presentation with speaker notes or a report.


### P2
Summarise the stages of data analysis (* Synoptic assessment from Unit 1 Fundamentals of IT, Unit 2 Global information)

#### Guidance
Learners must summarise all of the stages of data analysis to include purpose and relevance of each stage to the production of useful and cost
effective data. This could be presented as a presentation with speaker notes, a report or a guide to data analysts.

### M1
Explain the importance of accurately identifying information requirements prior to data collection

#### Guidance
Learners could use actual examples to highlight the importance of recognising the information requirements of a specific business need prior to data collection. Research may identify only issues arising from poor requirements planning but learners would be able to use such examples to emphasise the importance of accurately identifying requirements. This may take the form of a report or a presentation with speaker notes or a video presentation.
